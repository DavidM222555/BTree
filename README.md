# BTree
Basic B-Tree implementation in Java. Supports insertion and search on items that implement Comparable<T>. Will possibly look into supporting delete in the future.
In the tests suite I have three basic tests (one of which consists of 100 seeded random tests) that test the search property and max-degree property for each node after a series of insertions. These tests are ran for every degree of B-Tree from 3 to 15.
